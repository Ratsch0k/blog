In my first post I will take you through the journey of how I finally made this blog. I will discuss my requirements, the challenges I encountered, and about the solutions I implemented.

# Why
A personal blog is something I wanted to build for a long time but never came around doing.
Alongside my studies I have always been actively learning and exploring topics in the fields of development and security.
By undertaking smaller and larger project, and by solving security challenges I slowly built up a portfolio of achievements.

While showcasing development projects is relatively easy, since you have something visually to show or can simply link the project repository, showcasing knowledge and achievements in security-related topics is more difficult.
Thus, I wanted to build a personal blog to do just that.

# Requirements
My main requirement for this blog was that I wanted to write posts in markdown and serve them as statically generated html files.
This makes writing posts easy and doesn't require a complex and resource-heavy server.

I also wanted to use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to build the website.
In the past, I usually used [React](https://react.dev/) to build websites and was happy with it.
However, since discovering Svelte I always wanted to try it and thought that this would be the perfect opportunity.
